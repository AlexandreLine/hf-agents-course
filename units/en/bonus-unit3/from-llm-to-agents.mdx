# From LLMs to LLM Agents

We learned in the first unit of the course that LLM Agents are able to plan and make decisions. And while LLMs have enabled more natural interactions with NPCs, Agentic AI takes it a step further by allowing characters to make decisions, plan actions, and adapt to changing environments. 

This shift means NPCs can now exhibit goal-directed behaviors, leading to more dynamic and unpredictable gameplay.

Agentic AI empowers NPCs with:

- **Autonomy**: Making independent decisions based on the game state.
- **Adaptability**: Adjusting strategies in response to player actions.
- **Persistence**: Remembering past interactions to inform future behavior.

This shift transforms NPCs from reactive entities (react to your inputs) into proactive participants in the game world.

## The big limitation of Agents: it’s slow (for now)

However, let’s not be too much optimistic for now. Despite its potential, Agentic AI currently faces challenges in real-time applications. 

The reasoning and planning processes can introduce latency, making it less suitable for fast-paced games like *Doom* or *Super Mario Bros.*

For instance, check this difference between a Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent and an LLM Agent in Doom

However, turn-based games like *Pokémon* are ideal candidates, as they allow the AI enough time to deliberate and make strategic decisions.
