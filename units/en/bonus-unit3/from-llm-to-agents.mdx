# From LLMs to AI Agents

We learned in the [first unit](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/introduction) of the course that AI Agents are able to plan and make decisions. And while LLMs have enabled more natural interactions with NPCs, Agentic AI takes it a step further by allowing characters to make decisions, plan actions, and adapt to changing environments. 

This shift means NPCs can now directly interract with their environment through goal-directed behaviors. Ultimatly leading to more dynamic and unpredictable gameplay.

Agentic AI empowers NPCs with:

- **Autonomy**: Making independent decisions based on the game state.
- **Adaptability**: Adjusting strategies in response to player actions.
- **Persistence**: Remembering past interactions to inform future behavior.

This transforms NPCs from reactive entities (react to your inputs) into proactive participants in the game world. Which open up the door for inovative gameplays.


## The big limitation of Agents: **it’s slow** (for now)

However, let’s not be too much optimistic for now. Despite its potential, Agentic AI currently faces challenges in real-time applications. 

The reasoning and planning processes can introduce latency, making it less suitable for fast-paced games like *Doom* or *Super Mario Bros.*

Let's take the example of claude plays pokémon for instance, and pay attention to the number of token needed to **think** added to the number of token needed to **act**, we can understand that we would need other decoding strategies if wanted to play in real time.

A game should be played around 30 FPS minimum, so, it means that in theory, to be a real time AI  agent, it should be able to **act** 30 times a second which is not feasible.

However, turn-based games like *Pokémon* are ideal candidates, as they allow the AI enough time to deliberate and make strategic decisions.

That’s why in the next section, you’ll build your very own AI Agent to battle in Pokémon-style turn-based combat, and even challenge it yourself. Let’s get into it!
